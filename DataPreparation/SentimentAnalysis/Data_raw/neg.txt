\par it's so laddish and juvenile , only teenage boys could possibly find it funny . 
\par exploitative and largely devoid of the depth or sophistication that would make watching such a graphic treatment of the crimes bearable . 
\par [garbus] discards the potential for pathological study , exhuming instead , the skewed melodrama of the circumstantial situation . 
\par a visually flashy but narratively opaque and emotionally vapid exercise in style and mystification . 
\par the story is also as unoriginal as they come , already having been recycled more times than i'd care to count . 
\par about the only thing to give the movie points for is bravado -- to take an entirely stale concept and push it through the audience's meat grinder one more time . 
\par not so much farcical as sour . 
\par unfortunately the story and the actors are served with a hack script . 
\par all the more disquieting for its relatively gore-free allusions to the serial murders , but it falls down in its attempts to humanize its subject . 
\par a sentimental mess that never rings true . 
\par while the performances are often engaging , this loose collection of largely improvised numbers would probably have worked better as a one-hour tv documentary . 
\par interesting , but not compelling . 
\par on a cutting room floor somewhere lies . . . footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire . 
\par while the ensemble player who gained notice in guy ritchie's lock , stock and two smoking barrels and snatch has the bod , he's unlikely to become a household name on the basis of his first starring vehicle . 
\par there is a difference between movies with the courage to go over the top and movies that don't care about being stupid
\par nothing here seems as funny as it did in analyze this , not even joe viterelli as de niro's right-hand goombah . 
\par such master screenwriting comes courtesy of john pogue , the yale grad who previously gave us " the skulls " and last year's " rollerball . " enough said , except : film overboard ! 
\par here , common sense flies out the window , along with the hail of bullets , none of which ever seem to hit sascha . 
\par this 100-minute movie only has about 25 minutes of decent material . 
\par the execution is so pedestrian that the most positive comment we can make is that rob schneider actually turns in a pretty convincing performance as a prissy teenage girl . 
\par on its own , it's not very interesting . as a remake , it's a pale imitation . 
\par it shows that some studios firmly believe that people have lost the ability to think and will forgive any shoddy product as long as there's a little girl-on-girl action . 
\par a farce of a parody of a comedy of a premise , it isn't a comparison to reality so much as it is a commentary about our knowledge of films . 
\par as exciting as all this exoticism might sound to the typical pax viewer , the rest of us will be lulled into a coma . 
\par the party scenes deliver some tawdry kicks . the rest of the film . . . is dudsville . 
\par our culture is headed down the toilet with the ferocity of a frozen burrito after an all-night tequila bender \'c2\emdash  and i know this because i've seen 'jackass : the movie . '
\par the criticism never rises above easy , cynical potshots at morally bankrupt characters . . . 
\par the movie's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving , well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan , thinly sketched story . killing time , that's all that's going on here . 
\par stupid , infantile , redundant , sloppy , over-the-top , and amateurish . yep , it's " waking up in reno . " go back to sleep . 
\par somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates . 
\par the action clich\'c3\'a9s just pile up . 
\par payami tries to raise some serious issues about iran's electoral process , but the result is a film that's about as subtle as a party political broadcast . 
\par the only surprise is that heavyweights joel silver and robert zemeckis agreed to produce this ; i assume the director has pictures of them cavorting in ladies' underwear . 
\par another useless recycling of a brutal mid-'70s american sports movie . 
\par i didn't laugh . i didn't smile . i survived . 
\par please , someone , stop eric schaeffer before he makes another film . 
\par most of the problems with the film don't derive from the screenplay , but rather the mediocre performances by most of the actors involved
\par  . . . if you're just in the mood for a fun -- but bad -- movie , you might want to catch freaks as a matinee . 
\par curling may be a unique sport but men with brooms is distinctly ordinary . 
\par though the opera itself takes place mostly indoors , jacquot seems unsure of how to evoke any sort of naturalism on the set . 
\par there's no getting around the fact that this is revenge of the nerds revisited -- again . 
\par the effort is sincere and the results are honest , but the film is so bleak that it's hardly watchable . 
\par analyze that regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film's successes , with a few new swings thrown in . 
\par with flashbulb editing as cover for the absence of narrative continuity , undisputed is nearly incoherent , an excuse to get to the closing bout . . . by which time it's impossible to care who wins . 
\par stinks from start to finish , like a wet burlap sack of gloom . 
\par to the civilized mind , a movie like ballistic : ecks vs . sever is more of an ordeal than an amusement . 
\par equlibrium could pass for a thirteen-year-old's book report on the totalitarian themes of 1984 and farenheit 451 . 
\par the lack of naturalness makes everything seem self-consciously poetic and forced . . . it's a pity that [nelson's] achievement doesn't match his ambition . 
\par everything is off . 
\par when seagal appeared in an orange prison jumpsuit , i wanted to stand up in the theater and shout , 'hey , kool-aid ! '
\par an easy watch , except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character . 
\par imagine the cleanflicks version of 'love story , ' with ali macgraw's profanities replaced by romance-novel platitudes . 
\par pc stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion . 
\par forget the misleading title , what's with the unexplained baboon cameo ? 
\par an odd , haphazard , and inconsequential romantic comedy . 
\par though her fans will assuredly have their funny bones tickled , others will find their humor-seeking dollars best spent elsewhere . 
\par pascale bailly's rom-com provides am\'c3\'a9lie's audrey tautou with another fabuleux destin -- i . e . , a banal spiritual quest . 
\par a static and sugary little half-hour , after-school special about interfaith understanding , stretched out to 90 minutes . 
\par watching the chemistry between freeman and judd , however , almost makes this movie worth seeing . almost . 
\par  . . . a pretentious and ultimately empty examination of a sick and evil woman . 
\par the country bears has no scenes that will upset or frighten young viewers . unfortunately , there is almost nothing in this flat effort that will amuse or entertain them , either . 
\par the cumulative effect of watching this 65-minute trifle is rather like being trapped while some weird relative trots out the video he took of the family vacation to stonehenge . before long , you're desperate for the evening to end . 
\par the characters are never more than sketches . . . which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach . 
\par mattei's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination . 
\par only in its final surprising shots does rabbit-proof fence find the authority it's looking for . 
\par isn't as sharp as the original . . . despite some visual virtues , 'blade ii' just doesn't cut it . 
\par  . . . plays like a badly edited , 91-minute trailer ( and ) the director can't seem to get a coherent rhythm going . in fact , it doesn't even seem like she tried . 
\par maybe leblanc thought , " hey , the movie about the baseball-playing monkey was worse . " 
\par what you expect is just what you get . . . assuming the bar of expectations hasn't been raised above sixth-grade height . 
\par barry sonnenfeld owes frank the pug big time
\par the biggest problem with roger avary's uproar against the mpaa is that , even in all its director's cut glory , he's made a film that's barely shocking , barely interesting and most of all , barely anything . 
\par so riddled with unanswered questions that it requires gargantuan leaps of faith just to watch it plod along . 
\par i approached the usher and said that if she had to sit through it again , she should ask for a raise . 
\par earnest but heavy-handed . 
\par if sinise's character had a brain his ordeal would be over in five minutes but instead the plot goes out of its way to introduce obstacles for him to stumble over . 
\par too slow for a younger crowd , too shallow for an older one . 
\par there's a reason the studio didn't offer an advance screening . " the adventures of pluto nash " is a big time stinker . 
\par a punch line without a premise , a joke built entirely from musty memories of half-dimensional characters . 
\par takes one character we don't like and another we don't believe , and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and isn't very funny . 
\par the things this movie tries to get the audience to buy just won't fly with most intelligent viewers . 
\par even if the enticing prospect of a lot of nubile young actors in a film about campus depravity didn't fade amid the deliberate , tiresome ugliness , it
 would be rendered tedious by avary's failure to construct a story with even a trace of dramatic interest . 
\par sitting through the last reel ( spoiler alert ! ) is significantly less charming than listening to a four-year-old with a taste for exaggeration recount his halloween trip to the haunted house . 
\par confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve . 
\par deadly dull , pointless meditation on losers in a gone-to-seed hotel . 
\par with this new rollerball , sense and sensibility have been overrun by what can only be characterized as robotic sentiment . 
\par one can only assume that the jury who bestowed star hoffman's brother gordy with the waldo salt screenwriting award at 2002's sundance festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off
\par a movie more to be prescribed than recommended -- as visually bland as a dentist's waiting room , complete with soothing muzak and a cushion of predictable narrative rhythms . 
\par sex ironically has little to do with the story , which becomes something about 
how lame it is to try and evade your responsibilities and that you should never , ever , leave a large dog alone with a toddler . but never mind all that ; the boobs are fantasti
\par the script covers huge , heavy topics in a bland , surfacey way that doesn't offer any insight into why , for instance , good things happen to bad people . 
\par a portrait of alienation so perfect , it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers . 
\par the code talkers deserved better than a hollow tribute . 
\par skip the film and buy the philip glass soundtrack cd . 
\par feels like a cold old man going through the motions . 
\par dignified ceo's meet at a rustic retreat and pee against a tree . can you bear the laughter ? 
\par dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit
\par there's no point of view , no contemporary interpretation of joan's prefeminist plight , so we're left thinking the only reason to make the movie is because present standards allow for plenty of nudity . 
\par beware the quirky brit-com . they can and will turn on a dime from oddly humorous to tediously sentimental . 
\par has its moments -- and almost as many subplots . 
\par the gags , and the script , are a mixed bag . 
\par completely awful iranian drama . . . as much fun as a grouchy ayatollah in a cold mosque . 
\par narratively , trouble every day is a plodding mess . 
\par there's no point in extracting the bare bones of byatt's plot for purposes of bland hollywood romance . 
\par directors john musker and ron clements , the team behind the little mermaid , have produced sparkling retina candy , but they aren't able to muster a lot of emotional resonance in the cold vacuum of space . 
\par adam sandler's heart may be in the right place , but he needs to pull his head out of his butt
\par there's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for egoyan , but it's also one that , next to his best work , feels clumsy and convoluted . 
\par despite engaging offbeat touches , knockaround guys rarely seems interested in kicking around a raison d'etre that's as fresh-faced as its young-guns cast . 
\par it's all pretty tame . the most offensive thing about the movie is that hollywood expects people to pay to see it . 
\par the movie is a mess from start to finish . 
\par the trouble with making this queen a thoroughly modern maiden is that it also makes her appear foolish and shallow rather than , as was more likely , a victim of mental illness . 
\par i'm not saying that ice age doesn't have some fairly pretty pictures , but there's not enough substance in the story to actually give them life . 
\par in the telling of a story largely untold , bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar . 
\par the plot is nothing but boilerplate clich\'c3\'a9s from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that i
t's also too stupid to realize that they've already seen this exact same movie a hundred times
\par terminally brain dead production . 
\par some episodes work , some don't . 
\par beautifully filmed and well acted . . . but admittedly problematic in its narrative specifics . 
\par j . lo will earn her share of the holiday box office pie , although this movie makes one thing perfectly clear : she's a pretty woman , but she's no working girl . 
\par rymer doesn't trust laughs -- and doesn't conjure proper respect for followers of the whole dead-undead genre , who deserve more from a vampire pic than a few shrieky special effects . 
\par not only are the film's sopranos gags incredibly dated and unfunny , they also demonstrate how desperate the makers of this 'we're -doing-it-for -the-cash' sequel were . 
\par wow . i have not been this disappointed by a movie in a long time . 
\par off the hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director adam watstein with finishing it at all . 
\par it's a drag how nettelbeck sees working women -- or at least this working woman -- for whom she shows little understanding . 
\par watching harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but boyd's film offers little else of consequence . 
\par it's also curious to note that this film , like the similarly ill-timed antitrust , is easily as bad at a fraction the budget . 
\par 'ejemplo de una cinta en que no importa el talento de su reparto o lo interesante que pudo haber resultado su premisa , pues el resultado es francamente aburrido y , por momentos , deplorable . '
\par will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 . 
\par the problem is not that it's all derivative , because plenty of funny movies recycle old tropes . the problem is that van wilder does little that is actually funny with the material . 
\par there's nothing interesting in unfaithful whatsoever . 
\par none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think . 
\par a processed comedy chop suey . 
\par as spent screen series go , star trek : nemesis is even more suggestive of a 65th class reunion mixer where only eight surviving members show up -- and there's nothing to drink . 
\par fails as a dystopian movie , as a retooling of fahrenheit 451 , and even as a rip-off of the matrix . 
\par full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in . 
\par an erotic thriller that's neither too erotic nor very thrilling , either . 
\par the movie , like bartleby , is something of a stiff -- an extra-dry office comedy that seems twice as long as its 83 minutes . 
\par with its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters . . . margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake . 
\par if you value your time and money , find an escape clause and avoid seeing this trite , predictable rehash . 
\par the director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of new age-inspired good intentions , but the spell they cast isn't the least bit mesmerizing . 
\par everything is pegged into the groove of a new york dating comedy with 'issues' to simplify . 
\par a dramatic comedy as pleasantly dishonest and pat as any hollywood fluff . 
\par the cameo-packed , m : i-2-spoofing title sequence is the funniest 5 minutes to date in this spy comedy franchise . . . then mike myers shows up and ruins everything . 
\par it comes off as so silly that you wouldn't be surprised if ba , murdock and rest of the a-team were seen giving chase in a black and red van . 
\par the 50-something lovebirds are too immature and unappealing to care about . 
\par so genial is the conceit , this is one of those rare pictures that you root for throughout , dearly hoping that the rich promise of the script will be realized on the screen . it never is , not fully . 
\par even in the summertime , the most restless young audience deserves the dignity of an action hero motivated by something more than franchise possibilities . 
\par what with all the blanket statements and dime-store ruminations on vanity , the worries of the rich and sudden wisdom , the film becomes a sermon for most of its running time . 
\par one lousy movie . 
\par as gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film's creepy , clean-cut dahmer ( jeremy renner ) and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge . 
\par plodding , peevish and gimmicky . 
\par the four feathers is definitely horse feathers , but if you go in knowing that , you might have fun in this cinematic sandbox . 
\par oozes condescension from every pore . 
\par solaris " is a shapeless inconsequential move relying on the viewer to do most of the work . 
\par the direction , by george hickenlooper , has no snap to it , no wiseacre crackle or hard-bitten cynicism . 
\par  . . . hypnotically dull . 
\par though this saga would be terrific to read about , it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch . 
\par it has plenty of laughs . it just doesn't have much else . . . especially in a moral sense . 
\par an awful lot like one of [spears'] music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it . 
\par confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when i have to put up with 146 minutes of it . 
\par [h]ad i suffered and bled on the hard ground of ia drang , i'd want something a bit more complex than we were soldiers to be remembered by . 
\par occasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma . 
\par it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like my big fat greek wedding
\par by the time you reach the finale , you're likely wondering why you've been watching all this strutting and posturing . 
\par journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull . 
\par putting the primitive murderer inside a high-tech space station unleashes a pandora's box of special effects that run the gamut from cheesy to cheesier to cheesiest . 
\par  at its best , it's black hawk down with more heart . at its worst , it's rambo- meets-john ford . 
\par exactly what you'd expect from a guy named kaos . 
\par calculated swill . 
\par this movie . . . doesn't deserve the energy it takes to describe how bad it is . 
\par with or without ballast tanks , k-19 sinks to a harrison ford low . 
\par director oliver parker labors so hard to whip life into the importance of being earnest that he probably pulled a muscle or two . 
\par you might be shocked to discover that seinfeld's real life is boring . 
\par it's not nearly as fresh or enjoyable as its predecessor , but there are enough high points to keep this from being a complete waste of time . 
\par walsh can't quite negotiate the many inconsistencies in janice's behavior or compensate for them by sheer force of charm . 
\par this 10th film in the series looks and feels tired . 
\par it leers , offering next to little insight into its intriguing subject . 
\par i found myself growing more and more frustrated and detached as vincent became more and more abhorrent . 
\par one of the oddest and most inexplicable sequels in movie history . 
\par there's nothing to gain from watching they . it isn't scary . it hates its characters . it finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers . 
\par fear permeates the whole of stortelling , todd solondz' oftentimes funny , yet ultimately cowardly autocritique . 
\par the skirmishes for power waged among victims and predators settle into an undistinguished rhythm of artificial suspense . 
\par thoroughly awful . 
\par  . . . ice age treads predictably along familiar territory , making it a passable family film that won't win many fans over the age of 12 . 
\par though the film is well-intentioned , one could rent the original and get the same love story and parable . 
\par just too silly and sophomoric to ensnare its target audience . 
\par the video work is so grainy and rough , so dependent on being 'naturalistic' rather than carefully lit and set up , that it's exhausting to watch . 
\par truly terrible . 
\par a cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary . 
\par it gets bogged down by hit-and-miss topical humour before getting to the truly good stuff . 
\par an achingly enthralling premise , the film is hindered by uneven dialogue and plot lapses . 
\par it's tommy's job to clean the peep booths surrounding her , and after viewing this one , you'll feel like mopping up , too . 
\par rifkin no doubt fancies himself something of a hubert selby jr . , but there isn't an ounce of honest poetry in his entire script ; it's simply crude and unrelentingly exploitative . 
\par fluffy and disposible . 
\par such a bad movie that its luckiest viewers will be seated next to one of those ignorant pinheads who talk throughout the show . 
\par if you go into the theater expecting a scary , action-packed chiller , you might soon be looking for a sign . an exit sign , that is . 
\par holds limited appeal to those who like explosions , sadism and seeing people beat each other to a pulp . 
\par the dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed . 
\par a feature-length , r-rated , road-trip version of mama's family . 
\par what you end up getting is the vertical limit of surfing movies - memorable stunts with lots of downtime in between . 
\par stealing harvard doesn't care about cleverness , wit or any other kind of intelligent humor . 
\par bigelow handles the nuclear crisis sequences evenly but milks drama when she should be building suspense , and drags out too many scenes toward the end that should move quickly . 
\par there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening . 
\par imagine kevin smith , the blasphemous bad boy of suburban jersey , if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor . the result might look like vulgar . 
\par suffers from a lack of clarity and audacity that a subject as monstrous and pathetic as dahmer demands . 
\par what soured me on the santa clause 2 was that santa bumps up against 21st century reality so hard , it's icky . 
\par it's an 88-minute highlight reel that's 86 minutes too long . 
\par the film favors the scientific over the spectacular ( visually speaking ) . 
\par such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema . 
\par with the exception of mccoist , the players don't have a clue on the park . the acting isn't much better . 
\par the whole affair is as predictable as can be . 
\par a not-so-divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood with a hefty helping of re-fried green tomatoes .

\par star trek was kind of terrific once , but now it is a copy of a copy of a copy . 
\par [n]o matter how much good will the actors generate , showtime eventually folds under its own thinness . 
\par every potential twist is telegraphed well in advance , every performance respectably muted ; the movie itself seems to have been made under the influence of rohypnol . 
\par puts on airs of a hal hartley wannabe film -- without the vital comic ingredient of the hilarious writer-director himself . 
\par ver wiel's desperate attempt at wit is lost , leaving the character of critical jim two-dimensional and pointless .

\par gaghan . . . has thrown every suspenseful clich\'c3\'a9 in the book at this nonsensical story . 
\par a sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis . 
\par [p]artnering murphy with robert de niro for the tv-cops comedy showtime would seem to be surefire casting . the catch is that they're stuck with a script that prevents them from firing on all cylinders . 
\par 'you'll laugh for not quite and hour and a half , but come out feeling strangely unsatisfied . you'll feel like you ate a reeses without the peanut butter . . . '
\par gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance . 
\par parker should be commended for taking a fresh approach to familiar material , but his determination to remain true to the original text leads him to adopt a somewhat mannered tone . . . that ultimately dulls the human tragedy at the story's core . 
\par the director has injected self-consciousness into the proceedings at every turn . the results are far more alienating than involving . 
\par bogdanich is unashamedly pro-serbian and makes little attempt to give voice to the other side . 
\par a lack of thesis makes maryam , in the end , play out with the intellectual and emotional impact of an after-school special . 
\par the worst film of the year .

\par watching austin powers in goldmember is like binging on cotton candy . it's sweet and fluffy at the time , but it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied . 
\par the most anti-human big studio picture since 3000 miles to graceland . 
\par the film can depress you about life itself . 
\par i'm sure the filmmakers found this a remarkable and novel concept , but anybody who has ever seen an independent film can report that it is instead a cheap clich\'c3\'a9 . 
\par the acting is fine but the script is about as interesting as a recording of conversations at the wal-mart checkout line . 
\par its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers . 
\par the plot plummets into a comedy graveyard before janice comes racing to the rescue in the final reel . 
\par sometimes there are very , very good reasons for certain movies to be sealed in a jar and left on a remote shelf indefinitely . 
\par at 90 minutes this movie is short , but it feels much longer . 
\par here's my advice , kev . start reading your scripts before signing that dotted line . 
\par an alternately raucous and sappy ethnic sitcom . . . you'd be wise to send your regrets . 
\par an ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental . 
\par unfortunately , it's also not very good . especially compared with the television series that inspired the movie . 
\par it wraps up a classic mother/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it's not all new , at least it looks pretty . 
\par glazed with a tawdry b-movie scum . 
\par this is the kind of movie during which you want to bang your head on the seat in front of you , at its cluelessness , at its idiocy , at its utterly misplaced earnestness .

\par an inelegant combination of two unrelated shorts that falls far short of the director's previous work in terms of both thematic content and narrative strength . 
\par to build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved . 
\par with the cheesiest monsters this side of a horror spoof , which they isn't , it is more likely to induce sleep than fright . 
\par mild , meandering teen flick .

\par astonishing isn't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap . indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is deuces wild . 
\par one thing is for sure : this movie does not tell you a whole lot about lily chou-chou . 
\par with a tone as variable as the cinematography , schaeffer's film never settles into the light-footed enchantment the material needs , and the characters' quirks and foibles never jell into charm . 
\par to better understand why this didn't connect with me would require another viewing , and i won't be sitting through this one again . . . that in itself is commentary enough .

\par the mystery of enigma is how a rich historical subject , combined with so much first-rate talent . . . could have yielded such a flat , plodding picture . 
\par it throws quirky characters , odd situations , and off-kilter dialogue at us , all as if to say , " look at this ! this is an interesting movie ! " but the film itself is ultimately quite unengaging . 
\par the inherent limitations of using a video game as the source material movie are once again made all too clear in this schlocky horror/action hybrid .

\par a poorly scripted , preachy fable that forgets about unfolding a coherent , believable story in its zeal to spread propaganda . 
\par while it is interesting to witness the conflict from the palestinian side , longley's film lacks balance . . . and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context . 
\par woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the " saving private ryan " battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ? 
\par it's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun . 
\par  . . . jones , despite a definitely distinctive screen presence , just isn't able to muster for a movie that , its title notwithstanding , should have been a lot nastier if it wanted to fully capitalize on its lead's specific gifts .

\par why , you may ask , why should you buy the movie milk when the tv cow is free ? there's no good answer to that one . 
\par this slow-moving swedish film offers not even a hint of joy , preferring to focus on the humiliation of martin as he defecates in bed and urinates on the plants at his own birthday party .

\par there's the plot , and a maddeningly insistent and repetitive piano score that made me want to scream .

\par this is amusing for about three minutes . 
\par klein , charming in comedies like american pie and dead-on in election , delivers one of the saddest action hero performances ever witnessed . 
\par it's rare to see a movie that takes such a speedy swan dive from " promising " to " interesting " to " familiar " before landing squarely on " stupid " . 
\par this is the sort of low-grade dreck that usually goes straight to video --with a lousy script , inept direction , pathetic acting , poorly dubbed dialogue and murky cinematography , complete with visible boom mikes . 
\par the direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why . 
\par there are few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending . 
\par it won't harm anyone , but neither can i think of a very good reason to rush right out and see it . after all , it'll probably be in video stores by christmas , and it might just be better suited to a night in the living room than a night at the movies . 

\par looks more like a travel-agency video targeted at people who like to ride bikes topless and roll in the mud than a worthwhile glimpse of independent-community guiding lights . 
\par given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors' workshop that it is . 
\par they kept much of the plot but jettisoned the stuff that would make this a moving experience for people who haven't read the book .

\par [carvey's] characters are both overplayed and exaggerated , but then again , subtlety has never been his trademark . 
\par it's mildly interesting to ponder the peculiar american style of justice that plays out here , but it's so muddled and derivative that few will bother thinking it all through . 
\par this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension .

\par if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce . 
\par the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life . but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored . 
\par serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 . but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .

\par the timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off . 
\par i admire it and yet cannot recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time . 
\par a fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy . 
\par flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind .

\par the cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie's power as a work of drama . 
\par another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through . 
\par aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with townsend . when she speaks , her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music .

\par the issue of faith is not explored very deeply
\par it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest . 
\par the situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels .

\par so putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film . 
\par in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate .

\par though there's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish . 
\par unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .

\par rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the na\'c3\'aff's encounter with the world . 
\par mariah carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in glitter here in wisegirls . 
\par it's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it's all about the silences and if you're into that , have at it . 
\par i suspect that you'll be as bored watching morvern callar as the characters are in it . if you go , pack your knitting needles . 
\par the lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma . we don't even like their characters . 
\par some writer dude , i think his name was , uh , michael zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that i ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck . 
\par the movie doesn't generate a lot of energy . it is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously . 
\par this feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
\par the cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate .

\par did we really need a remake of " charade ? " 
\par some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth .

\par a relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty world war ii action flick .

\par you have no affinity for most of the characters . nothing about them is attractive . what they see in each other also is difficult to fathom . 
\par diaz , applegate , blair and posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused . 
\par a technically well-made suspenser . . . but its abrupt drop in iq points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide . 
\par an inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .

\par 'dragonfly' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue . 
\par in his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls . 
\par blade ii has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation . 
\par veers uncomfortably close to pro-serb propaganda .

\par final verdict : you've seen it all before . 
\par throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material . 
\par if a few good men told us that we " can't handle the truth " than high crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we " don't care about the truth . " 
\par further sad evidence that tom tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning run lola run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap .

\par the film has too many spots where it's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that's especially fit for the kiddies . 
\par purports to be a hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging . oh , and more entertaining , too . 
\par  . . . in the pile of useless actioners from mtv schmucks who don't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .

\par well-made but mush-hearted . 
\par humor in i spy is so anemic . 
\par the film is strictly routine . 
\par a real snooze . 
\par skillful as he is , mr . shyamalan is undone by his pretensions . 
\par while the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched stephen norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning david s . goyer is much sillier . 
\par in addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , ballistic : ecks vs . sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase . 

\par it shares the first two films' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between . 
\par the santa clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but i've got to give it thumbs down . 
\par you cannot guess why the cast and crew didn't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed . 
\par barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull . 
\par if you're really renting this you're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you're interested in anne geddes , john grisham , and thomas kincaid . 
\par we get the comedy we settle for . 
\par the uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them . 
\par two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning .

\par hey arnold ! is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation . still , the updated dickensian sensibility of writer craig bartlett's story is appealing . 
\par true to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at . 
\par doesn't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago .

\par kaufman's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious . 
\par the film didn't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due . 
\par queen of the damned is too long with too little going on . 
\par it collapses when mr . taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller's rush . 
\par any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss . 
\par  . . . blade ii is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves . 
\par the rules of attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing . 
\par though there are many tense scenes in trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful . 
\par in this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian . 
\par feels strangely hollow at its emotional core . 
\par no surprises . 
\par you have once again entered the bizarre realm where director adrian lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal . 
\par the high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : there's very little hustling on view . 
\par this director's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera . 
\par characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle . 
\par the venezuelans say things like " si , pretty much " and " por favor , go home " when talking to americans . that's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of " dragonfly . " 
\par it's a movie that ends with truckzilla , for cryin' out loud . if that doesn't clue you in that something's horribly wrong , nothing will . 
\par director tom shadyac and star kevin costner glumly mishandle the story's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself . 
\par it's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 . 
\par like the tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on
\par as pedestrian as they come . 
\par a film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen . 
\par it's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary . 
\par put it somewhere between sling blade and south of heaven , west of hell in the pantheon of billy bob's body of work . 
\par more intellectually scary than dramatically involving . 
\par an inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle . 
\par the abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture can't quite conceal that there's nothing resembling a spine here . 
\par as saccharine as it is disposable . 
\par you come away thinking not only that kate isn't very bright , but that she hasn't been worth caring about and that maybe she , janine and molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another . 
\par the metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery . 
\par very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all . 
\par too much power , not enough puff . 
\par the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show . 
\par it's provocative stuff , but the speculative effort is hampered by taylor's cartoonish performance and the film's ill-considered notion that hitler's destiny was shaped by the most random of chances . 
\par a cellophane-pop remake of the punk classic ladies and gentlemen , the fabulous stains . . . crossroads is never much worse than bland or better than inconsequential . 
\par muddled , trashy and incompetent
\par for this sort of thing to work , we need agile performers , but the proficient , dull sorvino has no light touch , and rodan is out of his league . 
\par narc is all menace and atmosphere . 
\par though excessively tiresome , the uncertainty principle , as verbally pretentious as the title may be , has its handful of redeeming features , as long as you discount its ability to bore . 
\par despite juliet stevenon's attempt to bring cohesion to pamela's emotional roller coaster life , it is not enough to give the film the substance it so desperately needs . 
\par it's tough to be startled when you're almost dozing . 
\par his [nelson's] screenplay needs some serious re-working to show more of the dilemma , rather than have his characters stage shouting matches about it . 
\par it's so downbeat and nearly humorless that it becomes a chore to sit through -- despite some first-rate performances by its lead . 
\par a terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving . 
\par there are many definitions of 'time waster' but this movie must surely be one of them . 
\par as it stands , crocodile hunter has the hurried , badly cobbled look of the 1959 godzilla , which combined scenes of a japanese monster flick with canned shots of raymond burr commenting on the monster's path of destruction . 
\par the thing looks like a made-for-home-video quickie . 
\par enigma is well-made , but it's just too dry and too placid .
